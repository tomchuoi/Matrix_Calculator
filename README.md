# Matrix Calculator
This program performs various operations on matrices, such as matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication, scalar multiplication, finding the inverse, determinant, eigenvalue, eigenvector and rank of a matrix. It also includes a function to generate a random matrix.

## Features
### The program offers the following features:
  - Reading matrices from files: It can read matrices from text files specified by the user.
  - Matrix Addition: It can add two matrices of the same size and store the result in a file.
  - Matrix Subtraction: It can subtract one matrix from another matrix of the same size and store the result in a file.
  - Matrix Multiplication: It can multiply two matrices and store the result in a file.
  - Scalar Multiplication: It can multiply a matrix by a scalar value and store the result in a file.
  - Matrix Inversion: It can find the inverse of a square matrix and store it in a file.
  - Matrix Determinant: It can calculate the determinant of a square matrix.
  - Matrix Rank: It can calculate the rank of a matrix.
  - Generating Random Matrix: It can generate a random matrix of specified dimensions and store it in a file.
  - Eigenvalue and eigenvector: It can find and compute eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector using Power Iteration algorithm.

## Notes:
  - The Python version of the program uses the Tkinter library to provide a graphical user interface (GUI) with menus and buttons.
  - On the other hand, the C version of the matrix calculator program offers both user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) and a streamlined Command-Line Interface (CLI) for performing various matrix operations, catering to different user preferences.
  - The Program Design and Operation Report was written in Vietnamese and for the python version of the program.
