## Features
### The program offers the following features:
  - Reading matrices from files: It can read matrices from text files specified by the user.
  - Matrix Addition: It can add two matrices of the same size and store the result in a file.
  - Matrix Subtraction: It can subtract one matrix from another matrix of the same size and store the result in a file.
  - Matrix Multiplication: It can multiply two matrices and store the result in a file.
  - Scalar Multiplication: It can multiply a matrix by a scalar value and store the result in a file.
  - Matrix Inversion: It can find the inverse of a square matrix and store it in a file.
  - Matrix Determinant: It can calculate the determinant of a square matrix.
  - Matrix Rank: It can calculate the rank of a matrix.
  - Generating Random Matrix: It can generate a random matrix of specified dimensions and store it in a file.

## Notes
  - The Python version of the program uses the Tkinter library to provide a graphical user interface (GUI) with menus and buttons.
  - On the other hand, the C version of the program displays the menu and options in the console, providing a command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction.
  - The Program Design and Operation Report was written in Vietnamese and for the python version of the program.
